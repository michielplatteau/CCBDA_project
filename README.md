For the plots I used chart.js, these are the things I needed to install to get this working:

```
pip install chartjs

npm install luxon chartjs-adapter-luxon --save
```

I might have forgotten something, in that case send me a message. Michiel.

This is how the result should look:

After running the django server you can find the chart prototype it under http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/.
